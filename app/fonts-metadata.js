The focus is on clear, easy-to-perceive letterforms that will not be readily confused with one another.   Starting with an initial draft of a basic lowercase Latin alphabet by Victor Gaultney, Annie Olsen refined the design and added over 4,700 glyphs, including a complete extended Cyrillic set.   A sans serif font is preferred by some literacy personnel for teaching people to read. Its forms are simpler and less cluttered than those of most serif fonts. For years, literacy workers have had to make do with fonts that were not really suitable for beginning readers and writers. In some cases, literacy specialists have had to tediously assemble letters from a variety of fonts in order to get all of the characters they need for their particular language project, resulting in confusing and unattractive publications. Andika addresses those issues.   The font has been upgraded in May 2022. This upgrade gives additional weight styles and expands the glyphset to support full Latin and Cyrillic characters sets. Rendering is also much improved.

It all started with a desire to learn more about the origin of strokes in human handwriting. It is designed to reflect a trace of writing tools and convey its inspiration. The family consists of 6 weights that can be used in headlines or body text.The outer curves contrast with the angled inner counter shapes, which distributes feelings of strength and softness at the same time. Athiti can be used with a mixture of formal and informal content, for example in educational work.A similarity between some glyphs such as ก ถ ภ ฤ ฦ, ฎ ฏ, บ ป, or ข ช is something to take into consideration because it might lead to confusion when typesetting very short texts. A specific approach has been taken for dealing with thick and thin strokes in the Thai design. Other type designers may consider this font as an example when developing new fonts. Informal loopless Thai typefaces have slightly simplified details, as compared to the formal looped style, and this allows type designers to extend loopless families to very black weights.Sizes and positions of vowels and tone marks need to be managed carefully because they are all relevant to readability, legibility, and overall texture.Also, in this case, ink trapping is required when connecting two specific strokes of each glyph, and it has to be done carefully, as it has been in Athiti.The Athiti project is led by Cadson Demak, a type foundry in Thailand.

    "description": "B612 is an highly legible open source font family, designed and tested to be used on aircraft cockpit screens.Its design makes it particularly suitable for degraded contexts (ensuring legibility and readability of data), with a positive effect on reducing visual fatigue and cognitive load. Particular attention was given to the uniformity of the typeface, whether being used for isolated terms, reading information on a map, mixing capital letters and numbers, waypoint lists, long or abbreviated texts, specific terms and data in the aeronautical field.In 2010, Airbus initiated a research collaboration with ENAC and Université de Toulouse III on a prospective study to define and validate an “Aeronautical Font”: the challenge was to improve the display of textual data information on all cockpit screens, concerning more specifically legibility, readability and reading comfort, and to enhance the overall cockpit consistency. The typographical research was conducted through iterations from experimentation to design. Two years later, Airbus came to Intactile DESIGN in order to design and develop the eight variants of the font. Baptized B612 in reference to the imaginary asteroid of the aviator Antoine de Saint‑Exupéry, the font has been optimised following a calligraphic approach, in order to preserve the readable qualities of humanist typefaces like réales and incises, but also the technical and functional image of sans serif or bitmap.B612 is a two-weight font family including roman and italic styles but also a monospaced variation, B612 Mono.

    "description": "B612 is an highly legible open source font family, designed and tested to be used on aircraft cockpit screens. Its design makes it particularly suitable for degraded contexts (ensuring legibility and readability of data), with a positive effect on reducing visual fatigue and cognitive load. Particular attention was given to the uniformity of the typeface, whether being used for isolated terms, reading information on a map, mixing capital letters and numbers, waypoint lists, long or abbreviated texts, specific terms and data in the aeronautical field.In 2010, Airbus initiated a research collaboration with ENAC and Université de Toulouse III on a prospective study to define and validate an “Aeronautical Font”: the challenge was to improve the display of textual data information on all cockpit screens, concerning more specifically legibility, readability and reading comfort, and to enhance the overall cockpit consistency. The typographical research was conducted through iterations from experimentation to design. Two years later, Airbus came to Intactile DESIGN in order to design and develop the eight variants of the font. Baptized B612 in reference to the imaginary asteroid of the aviator Antoine de Saint‑Exupéry, the font has been optimised following a calligraphic approach, in order to preserve the readable qualities of humanist typefaces like réales and incises, but also the technical and functional image of sans serif or bitmap.B612 is a two-weight font family including roman and italic styles but also a monospaced variation, B612 Mono. It was designed in 2012 by Nicolas Chauveau, Thomas Paillot and Jonathan Favre-Lamarine from the design agency <a href=\"http://intactile.com\" target=\"_blank\">Intactile DESIGN</a>, and Jean-Luc Vinot from ENAC (French National University of Civil Aviation) <a href=\"http://www.enac.fr/en/interactive-informatics-team\" target=\"_blank\">Interactive Informatics Team</a> for Laurent Spaggiari from the <a href=\"https://www.airbus.com\" target=\"_blank\">Airbus</a> Human Factors department — prior research by Jean‑Luc Vinot (DGAC/DSNA) and Sylvie Athènes (Université de Toulouse III).

It has diagonal stress, and a soft variation in contrast to improve legibility. It is bolder than normal for better rasterization on screen. The typeface works smoothly at text sizes with its delicate serifs, which gives a crisp effect on the screen. At larger sizes it shows a strong personality with the combination of serif details and the modulation of its strokes. It is useful for both short text and headlines, but it is also comfortable for reading on screen. Designed by Dario Muhafara for <a href=\"http://www.tipo.net.ar\">tipo foundry</a>.",

The ANRT workshop aimed to digitize Jacob’s font in order to show his work which moves from transitional to modern styles.   Baskervville was designed by the ANRT students from 2017 (Alexis Faudot, Rémi Forte, Morgane Pierson, Rafael Ribas, Tanguy Vanlaeys and Rosalie Wagner), under the direction of Charles Mazé.

    "description": "People read and interact with text on screens more and more each day. What happens on screen ends up being more important than what comes out of the printer. With the accelerating popularity of electronic books, type designers are working hard to seek out the ideal designs for reading on screen. Motivated by her love for the pixel, Sol Matas designed Bitter. A \"contemporary\" slab serif typeface for text, it is specially designed for comfortably reading on any computer or device. The robust design started from the austerity of the pixel grid, based on rational rather than emotional principles. It combines the large x-heights and legibility of the humanistic tradition with subtle characteristics in the characters that inject a certain rhythm to flowing texts. Bitter has little variation in stroke weight and the Regular style is thicker than a usual ‘Regular’ style for print design. This generates an intense color in paragraphs, accentuated by the serifs that are as thick as strokes with square terminals. Each glyph is carefully designed with an excellent curve quality added to the first stage of the design, that was entirely made in a pixel grid. The typeface is balanced and manually spaced to use very few kerning pairs. To contribute, see <a href=\"https://github.com/solmatas/BitterPro\">github.com/solmatas/BitterPro</a>.",

The aesthetical matching process between the two scripts relies on the features of being hand-drawn with a reed pen. While Latin letterforms maintain sharp edges, Arabic relies on sharp edges and thick strokes to create overlaps to replace a usual baseline in most letterforms, giving the Arabic letterforms contemporary features.   The font family comes in two styles, Blaka and Blaka Hollow, featuring an outlined version of the font. Blaka also comes in two variants, the usual monochrome variants as well as an Ink variant <em>Blaka Ink</em>. The Ink variant are color fonts where the colors are defined by the font itself. Support for color fonts is currently limited to few applications like Google Chrome (version 98 or later).

In this way, it was possible to converge the inclination of an Upright Sans Serif with a Sans Serif Italic.  Looking at the font in detail, the bottom halves of the glyphs have Transitive serifs while the upper halves conserve the Sans Serif terminals.  Other specific details can be seen in the a, g, and e glyphs, which have an Italic structure, not an Upright one.  In addition, the glyph for the letter r has a relatively closed instroke. The references used to develop this font were Bree from TypeTogether, Parisine de Porchez Typofonderie, and, undeniably, Ludovico Degli Arrighi's manuscript about the structure the \"humanistic cursive\" that is Convergence.

The first Crimson design was initiated by Sebastian Kosch in 2009, and he later completely redrew a new version called Crimson Prime. Google commissioned Jacques Le Bailly to review both typefaces, and develop Crimson Pro as a new design that synthesises both designs into a final authoritative family, first released in January 2019. All decisions were made to enable better readability for longer texts and the ability to make good and diverse typography.

It was redesigned to be recognizable by contemporary Hebrew readers, since the original Sheqel symbol is too far from today's standard.Latin characters from the Gentium typeface were derived and integrated to accommodate cases in which Latin and Hebrew characters will be used in tandem.Each font includes OpenType features required for diacritic marks (nikud) and Hebrew-specific uses, including alternative Hebrew-height numerals (available as Stylistic Set 1) an alternative \"Hebrew ampersand\" symbol designed by Ismar David (available in Stylistic Set 2) and an alternative Sheqel symbol designed by Ismar David (available in Stylistic Set 3.)Every effort was made to keep the original designs intact, and the type's original spacing is well preserved. However, several changes have been made to fit with David Libre's goal to be used as a free alternative to the David font commonly installed on PCs. In order to be compatible with documents previously set in the version of David bundled with Microsoft Windows, David Hadash's glyph size has been reduced by 12.5%. This was made to prevent cases in which documents previously typed in Microsoft's David to take up more pages and cause odd line breaks. Please note that this does not guarantee full compatibility with that David, only a close approximation.Diacritic marks have been repositioned. Biblical cantillation marks are not supported.The construction of David Libre was made by Meir Sadan, commissioned by Google for the Google Fonts project.The David Libre project is led by Meir Sadan, a type designer based in Tel Aviv, Israel.

He brought everything the original type offered as a start, a set of upper case characters, numbers, and some punctuation marks. But what he brought in printed form was not enough to meet his needs, and letterforms that did not exist had to be created. It is a fine job to reinterpret a design, to make decisions on what already exists and also have in mind the changes needed for the new technological context where Diplomata will be used.

    "description": "Diplomata started several years ago when a friend in the printing industry who had an old metal typeface wanted it to be digitalized for offset printing. He brought everything the original type offered as a start, a set of upper case characters, numbers, and some punctuation marks. But what he brought in printed form was not enough to meet his needs, and letterforms that did not exist had to be created. It is a fine job to reinterpret a design, to make decisions on what already exists and also have in mind the changes needed for the new technological context where Diplomata will be used.

When I start sketching I knew it would be a little less condensed than the original Empire because I wanted it to be used for use in titles, and combined with positive letter spacing it gives an elegant look to text. Although the original hasn't got a lowercase, I studied a lot of skyline typefaces and drew a fully original lowercase. I started with lowercase “o”, which isn't completely geometric, it is expanded to the outside, keeping the same whitespace through all weights. And this repeats all over the typeface, because the construction of all the characters was modular, based on that “o”; the “f” is designed to not meet any of the diacritics; and uppercase “A” has a traditional form, because I think this is more legible.",

From the early 1930s through World War II, there were about 200 professional hand letterers working in New York City alone. This occupation saw its demise with the advent of photo lettering, and after digital typography it became virtually extinct. The odd way in which the Bluemlein scripts were assembled and created - by collecting different signatures and then building complete alphabets from them - is a fascinating calligraphic adventure. Because the set of constructed designs looked nothing like the original signatures, fictitious names were assigned to the new script typefaces. The typeface styles were then showcased in Higgins Ink catalogs. Alejandro Paul and Sudtipos bring the Bluemlein scripts back to life in a set of expanded digital versions, reflecting the demands of today’s designer. Extreme care has been taken to render the original scripts authentically, keeping the fictitious names originally assigned to them by Bluemlein.",

It is a community project to create a revival of Claude Garamont’s famous humanist typefaces from the mid-16th century. This digital version reproduces the original design by Claude Garamont closely: The source for the letterforms is a scan of a specimen known as the “Berner specimen,” which was composed in 1592 by Conrad Berner, the son-in-law of Christian Egenolff and his successor at the Egenolff print office. This specimen shows Garamont’s roman and Granjon’s italic types at different sizes. Hence the name of this project: Egenolff-Berner Garamond.   Why another Garamond? That typeface is a key moment in the history of typography, and European type designers have been reacting to this work ever since. It is probably the most revived typeface in the world and many are excellent. In the world of free/libre culture, however, only a few Garamond-inspired types exist, and none share the scope of this project.   In November 2019, the family has been updated to a variable font family.

This typeface family was designed for the output of inkjet printers. It was inspired by the concept of saving space in publishing texts without loss of height. This means it is a very condensed type. The visual advantage of Economica is that accomplishes this horizontal compression while keeping a strong personality. It is not a typical, neutral, sans serif. The open forms and tendency towards flattened curves allow it to be used in very small spaces while retaining high legibility.

Many Israeli books, newspapers and magazines use Frank Rühl as their main body text typeface.Made to accommodate the growing need for typefaces in secular Hebrew writings, the typeface was fitted to modern printing demands and designed to be readable in longform text, with and without vowel marks. Frank Rühl has Sephardi proportions (mem-height is approximately 4½ stroke widths), and is based roughly on Venetian typefaces used by printer Daniel Bomberg. Frank wrote of his design that he wishes to combine the simpleness of Antiqua with the \"pleasantness\" of Fraktur, leading him to \"quieten\" the letterforms by reducing the contrast between its thin and thick strokes.This newly designed revival by Yanek Iontef is a family of 7 weights, Light to Black (the original typeface had only one) and in November 2022, it became variable and offers a larger choice of weights.To contribute, see <a href=\"https://github.com/fontef/frankruhllibre\">github.com/fontef/frankruhllibre</a>.",

Didot’s type was the base for a new font, GFS Didot (1994), which was designed by Takis Katsoulidis, and digitised by George Matthiopoulos, of the <a href=\"https://www.greekfontsociety-gfs.gr\">Greek Font Society</a>.

Furthermore, by the end of the 19th century bibliology had become an established section of Historical Studies, and, as John Bowman commented, the prevailing attitude was that Greek types should adhere to a lost idealized, yet undefined, greekness of yore. Especially in Great Britain this tendency remained unchallenged in the first decades of the 20th century, both by Richard Proctor, curator of the incunabula section in the British Museum Library and his successor Victor Scholderer. In 1927, Scholderer, on behalf of the Society for the Promotion of Greek Studies, got involved in choosing and consulting the design and production of a Greek type called New Hellenic cut by the Lanston Monotype Corporation. He chose the revival of a round, and almost monoline type which had first appeared in 1492 in the edition of Macrobius, ascribable to the printing shop of Giovanni Rosso (Joannes Rubeus) in Venice. New Hellenic was the only successful typeface in Great Britain after the introduction of Porson Greek well over a century before. The type, since to 1930’s, was also well received in Greece, albeit with a different design for Ξ and Ω. GFS digitized the typeface (1993-1994) funded by the Athens Archeological Society with the addition of a new set of epigraphical symbols.

My approach to the smallcaps lead to a set of letters that perfectly complements the main caps but which simultaneously becomes softer and more gentle because of its more square proportion.Girassol feels at home set in large, striking titles and smaller graphical vignettes.To contribute, see <a href=\"https://github.com/liamspradlin/Girassol-Display\">github.com/liamspradlin/Girassol-Display</a>.",

Each element can take one of 23 shapes and transition smoothly between them while creating various effects. The font currently supports these scripts: Arabic, Armenian, Cyrillic, Greek, Hebrew, and Latin.   Due to rendering issues specific to Mac OS, the font may show aberrations and visual artifacts, resulting in an unusual appearance.   Handjet is designed by David Březina with the contribution of Johannes Neumeier, Borna Izadpanah, Khajag Apelian and Meir Sadan.

  "Handlee": {
    "description": "Handlee is loosely based on the handwriting of typographer Joe Prince. Its inconsistent curves give it a nice, human-like quality that is reflected in the characters. Each glyph is stationed at a different position in respect to the baseline, and ascenders and descenders vary, which all contribute to the human-like qualities of the font. Handlee is a great font for any web page looking to add some personality and charisma. There was careful attention to detail in removing unnecessary overlap between letters, which allows Handlee to be scaled down to very small sizes while still maintaining legibility. The diaritics were purposefully designed at a slightly larger scale than normal to add to the ability to be scaled down. Also, the accents on the accented characters were not automatically generated but were rather hand placed individually to portray asymmetry and inconsistency that is typically found in handwriting. All of the little details and careful considerations in Handlee make it the perfect font for any project.",

This font provides a simplified rendering of Arabic script, using basic connecting glyphs but not including a wide variety of additional ligatures or contextual alternates (only the required lam-alef ligatures.) Harmattan Version 2.000 (released in June 2020) now includes a Bold style and contains near complete coverage of all the characters defined in Unicode 13.0 for Arabic script (excluding the Arabic Presentation Forms blocks, which are not recommended for normal use). It has full support for the Arabic and Arabic Supplement Unicode blocks, and the Arabic Extended-A block with the exception of U+08D3..U+08E2. In 2023 an additional two weights for this typeface family were added for a total of four weights now. The glyphset was expanded to support all of the Unicode 15.0 character set. Support for the Kyrgyz language was added. Bob Hallissy does Graphite, OpenType, and TypeTuner code, and build support. Becca Hirsbrunner is the Lead Designer. George W. Nuss is the Original Designer. Iska Routamaa is a Contributing Designer. The Harmattan project is maintained by SIL International. Harmattan is released under the SIL Open Font License.

    "description": "The Charles Bluemlein Script Collection is an intriguing reminder of the heady days of hand lettering and calligraphy in the United States. From the early 1930s through World War II, there were about 200 professional hand letterers working in New York City alone. This occupation saw its demise with the advent of photo lettering, and after digital typography it became virtually extinct. The odd way in which the Bluemlein scripts were assembled and created - by collecting different signatures and then building complete alphabets from them - is a fascinating calligraphic adventure. Because the set of constructed designs looked nothing like the original signatures, fictitious names were assigned to the new script typefaces. The typeface styles were then showcased in Higgins Ink catalogs. Alejandro Paul and Sudtipos bring the Bluemlein scripts back to life in a set of expanded digital versions, reflecting the demands of today’s designer. Extreme care has been taken to render the original scripts authentically, keeping the fictitious names originally assigned to them by Bluemlein.",

In other words, the Devanagari base characters are 94% as tall as the Latin uppercase. Text set in the Devanagari script sits nicely alongside the Latin lowercase, too. Hind’s Devanagari vowel marks take forms that tends toward the traditional end of the design spectrum, while the knotted terminals inside of the base characters feature a treatment that appears more contemporary.Each font in the Hind family has 1146 glyphs, which include hundreds of unique Devanagari conjuncts.

While at display sizes they add a crisp and sharp impression. Uppercase letters are decently heavier compared to lowercase as a tribute to the old typographic tradition.

Inconsolata draws from many inspirations and sources. I was particularly struck by the beauty of Luc(as) de Groot's Consolas, which is his monospaced design for Microsoft's Vista release. This font, similar to his earlier TheSansMono, demonstrated clearly to me that monospaced fonts do not have to suck.   The development of the Regular style by Raph Levien was started in 2006 using his own Spiro-based tools and FontForge. The Bold style was designed by Kirill Tkachev and the Cyreal foundry in 2012.   <b>Updated September 2015:</b> Internal metadata corrected.   <b>Updated April 2020:</b> Family has been upgraded to a variable font family.

What happens on screen ends up being more important than what comes out of the printer. With the accelerating popularity of electronic books, type designers are working hard to seek out the ideal designs for reading on screen.Motivated by Sol's love for the pixel she designed Bitter, and later Kadwa.A \"contemporary\" slab serif typeface for text, it is specially designed for comfortably reading on any computer or device. The robust design started from the austerity of the pixel grid, based on rational rather than emotional principles. It combines the large x-heights and legibility of the humanistic tradition with subtle characteristics in the characters that inject a certain rhythm to flowing texts.It has little variation in stroke weight and the Regular is darker than a typical typeface intended for use in print.This generates an intense color in paragraphs, accentuated by the serifs that are as thick as strokes, with square terminals.Each glyph is carefully designed with an excellent curve quality added to the first stage of the design, that was entirely made in a pixel grid. The typeface is balanced and manually spaced to use very few kerning pairs, especially important for web font use since most browsers do not currently support this feature.The Kadwa project is led by Sol Matas, a type designer based in Berlin, Germany.

    "description": "Kanit means mathematics in Thai, and the Kanit typeface family is a formal Loopless Thai and Sans Latin design.It is a combination of concepts, mixing a Humanist Sans Serif motif with the curves of Capsulated Geometric styles that makes it suitable for various uses, contemporary and futuristic.A notable detail is that the stroke terminals have flat angles, which allows the design to enjoy decreased spacing between letters while preserving readability and legibility at smaller point sizes.In Thai typeface design the formal loopless Thai typefaces have more simple forms than the conservative looped Thai designs, and this simplification has to be done properly in order to preserve the essential character of each letter. Sizes and positions of vowels and tone marks need to be managed carefully because they are all relevant to readability, legibility, and overall textures.When designing Kanit, special care was taken with some groups of letters such as ก ถ ภ ฤ ฦ, ฎ ฏ, บ ป, and ข ช to ensure they are distinct and legible, because it might lead to confusion if each glyph is not clear enough.Kanit is the first Thai font family to be hinted with <a href=\"http://www.freetype.org/ttfautohint/\">TTFAutohint</a>, an easy-to-use hinting tool that is highly recommended.The Kanit project is led by Cadson Demak, a type foundry in Thailand.To contribute, see <a href=\"http://github.com/cadsondemak/kanit\">github.com/cadsondemak/kanit</a>",

    "description": " Khand is a family of compact mono-linear fonts with very open counter forms. Developed for display typography, the family is primarily intended for headline usage. Its letterforms are dynamic, and everything is designed according to a modular system. All of its shapes bear a strong commonality to one another, but the typeface strikes a good balancing act and avoids too much repetitiveness. The lighter styles are suitable for short paragraphs of running text, while the heavier styles have been optimized for headlines or single word settings.   The base character height in the Khand fonts is ‘big on the body.’ Across a line of text, the consonantal forms take up the majority of vertical space. Vowel marks above and below have been shortened – keeping these to a minimum allows for lines of text to be set more closely together vertically. The reduction of interlinear space is paramount for successful headline typesetting, and Khand performs much better in display applications than similar fonts with more elongated vowel marks. Because of their reduced height, the typeface’s vowel mark forms have been simplified somewhat out of necessity, but this stylistic reduction is in-keeping with the modular feeling of the typeface’s overall design. Dot-shaped marks appear rounded in order to help maintain their differentiation from other marks.   Khand’s Devanagari component was designed by Sanchit Sawaria and Jyotish Sonowal. The Latin component was designed by Satya Rajpurohit. To contribute, see <a href=\"https://github.com/itfoundry/khand\">github.com/itfoundry/khand</a> ",

The main focus of the films produced in this period was on popular subjects such as romances, musicals and unrealistic heroic characters. The movie posters designed to represent these films were also intended to exaggerate these elements by the use of provocative imagery and a particular type of display lettering. These bold and dynamic letterforms were so popular and widely used that perhaps one can consider them the most significant component of film posters in that period. Lalezar is an attempt to revive the appealing qualities in this genre of lettering and transform them into a modern Arabic display typeface and a suitable Latin companion. Although the main inspiration comes from a style of lettering that was used to represent the Persian language, here the objective is to design a typeface that can be used for most of the languages that use the Arabic script for their written communication.

Classical proportions, particularly in the uppercase, give the letterforms familiar harmony and elegance, and combine with a sleek treatement that feels contemporary without being trendy.

It means that the space are modular, 250, 500, 750, this allow a better spacing between characters, but allow also a vertical alignment similar to the one possible with a monospaced font.

Initially they were designed with dyslexia and struggling readers in mind, but Bonnie Shaver-Troup, creator of the Lexend project, soon found out that these fonts are also great for everyone else.

This new version of Lexend is a variable font with a weight axis.   Please note that the initial release of this font had a lighter Regular weight. It has been decided for the update of July 2021 to align the Regular weight with the one of Lexend Deca which is slightly bolder. Lexend and Lexend Deca are therefore the same (for now…). Ultimately this version will offer a HyperExpansion axis which will allow variation of inner and outer space of letterforms.  True to Bonnie’s vision, Lexend fonts are freely available for all since 2019 in Google Fonts.

Livvic was designed to capture LV=’s brand values and uniqueness. It is an open, friendly and somewhat quirky design. Corporate, yet still fresh and personal.The Roman is an upright Italic, with some inspirations from handwriting. This gives livvic a strong, yet accessible character. The Italic has matching metrics to the Roman. Although the Italic and Roman share a lot of similarities, the construction is different. It is gives the Italic some more panache.

Mitr is a novel and friendly typeface that is suitable for casual usage such as celebration cards, magazines, and posters.A similarity between some glyphs such as ก ถ ภ ฤ ฦ, ฎ ฏ, บ ป, or ข ช is something to take into consideration because it might lead to confusion when typesetting very short texts. Mitr has a specific approach to the thick and thin strokes of Thai glyphs. Other type designers may consider this font as an example when developing new fonts. Informal looped Thai typefaces have slightly simplified details, as compared to formal ones, and this allows type designers to extend them to heavier weights. The size and position of Thai vowel and tone marks have been managed carefully because they are all relevant to readability, legibility, and overall texture.

As urban development changes that place, it will never return to its original form and loses forever the designs that are so special and unique. The letters that inspired this project have work, dedication, care, color, contrast, light and life, day and night! These are the types that make the city look so beautiful. The Montserrat Project began with the idea to rescue what is in Montserrat and set it free under a libre license, the SIL Open Font License.   This is the normal family, and it has two sister families so far, <a href=\"http://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat+Alternates\">Alternates</a> and <a href=\"http://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat+Subrayada\">Subrayada</a>. Many of the letterforms are special in the Alternates family, while 'Subrayada' means 'Underlined' in Spanish and celebrates a special style of underline that is integrated into the letterforms found in the <em>Montserrat</em> neighborhood.   Updated November 2017: The family was redrawn by Jacques Le Bailly at <a href=\"http://www.baronvonfonthausen.com/\">Baron von Fonthausen</a> over the summer, and the full set of weights were adjusted to make the Regular lighter and better for use in longer texts.

Two italics &mdash; one will be called \"italic\", and the other \"cursive\" &mdash; are uncommon, but very useful. Ever tried emphasizing something already emphasized? Beyond that obvious example, there are other uses. Sometimes a text needs a different flavor or feel. While one roman can work for a variety of texts, the companion italics don't always. In more classical or personal documents, a stiff, sober, modern and down-to-earth italic will never work. And in many essays, some of the fancier italics look ridiculous.

I love this handwriting because it is human, it is imperfect, and it is natural.  Real humans don’t write perfectly neatly, and this font creates that feeling of authenticity.",

  "Noticia Text": {
    "description": "Noticia Text is a contemporary humanist slab serif typeface designed to be used for running text on digital newspapers (both on websites and mobile apps). It has a large x-height, ample proportions, big serifs and large apertures that allow the letters to be clear, even at small sizes on low resolution screens. The capitals are unusually small, allowing them to be used as substitutes for small caps. (It's recommended to add some tracking if used in this way.) One major feature is the break in the internal curves of round characters. While this break makes some interesting forms at large sizes, their true purpose is to help make the counterforms more open at small sizes by allowing straighter stems. This reasoning is famously known as W.A. Dwiggins' “M-formula.” The italics were designed to contrast with the roman styles while maintaining good legibility. The true italic forms also have big counterforms and simple curves. The fonts have been manually hinted to get the best possible rasterization in Windows. The Noticia font family project is envisioned as 18 different fonts styles, with text, condensed, display and sans variants, different weights and including italic versions, all designed and hinted to work well on computer and mobile devices screens.",

With an unapologetic tendency for public shouting, it is a whimsical loudmouth attention seeker! \"Oi\" is an interjection used in various languages. Its meaning varies, depending on the tone and abruptness of its use, from a simple “hi” or a call of attention to as far as a challenge to a fight.

    "description": "Lobster is one of the most popular web fonts, designed by Pablo Impallari. Pattaya is a version of Lobster extended into Thai, and supports Latin and all variations of the Thai script with an informal loopless design.However, vertical metrics (that effect line-spacing) had to be adjusted in order to support Thai vowels and tone marks, so this is published as a separate family. A similarity between some glyphs such as ก ถ ภ ฤ ฦ, ฎ and ฏ, บ and ป, or ข and ช is something to take into consideration because it might lead to confusion when typesetting very short texts. Pattaya has a specific approach to the thick and thin strokes of Thai glyphs. Other type designers of Thai fonts may like to use this approach as a reference. Informal loopless Thai tyefaces have slightly simplified details, as compared to formal ones, and this simplification has to be done properly in order to preserve the character of each glyph.The size and position of Thai vowel and tone marks need to be managed carefully, because they are all relevant to readability, legibility, and overall texture.The Pattaya project is led by Cadson Demak, a type foundry in Thailand.

Taking inspiration in Neuzeit Grotesk, Futura, and 1930s grotesque sans serifs with almost monolinear contrast and pointy curves, the fonts consist of modern and clean cut forms, the x-height dimension slightly taller to provide clear spaces between caps and x-height, and also equipped with open counters and balanced spaces to preserve the legibility at a large range of sizes.   The beauty of diversity captured in typography. Like the city itself, the uniqueness of this font is that in some glyphs it has its own diversity and characteristic of various explorations of forms that enrich the expressions and stories that coexist. The charms of Plus Jakarta Sans fonts appear when one looks closer, manifesting in a beauty that emerges once seen as a whole. Each alternate in the family contains several alternative characters, divided into three stylistic sets which Lancip (Sharp), Lurus (Straight), and Lingkar (Swirl).

The Devanagari design was particularly novel when it was first published in 2015, and was the first ever Devanagari typeface with a range of weights in this genre. Just like the Latin, the Devanagari is based on pure geometry, particularly circles.Each letterform is nearly monolinear, with optical corrections applied to stroke joints where necessary to maintain an even typographic color. The Devanagari base character height and the Latin ascender height are equal; Latin capital letters are shorter than the Devanagari characters, and the Latin x-height is set rather high.The project was developed by Indian Type Foundry (ITF). The Devanagari was initially designed by Ninad Kale, while the Latin was initially designed by Jonny Pinhorn. Following their principal phase of designing the first 5 styles, the typeface was later refined, and expanded to include multiple weights and italics, by the ITF studio team.To contribute, see <a href=\"https://github.com/itfoundry/poppins\">github.com/itfoundry/poppins</a>",

  "Puritan": {
    "description": "I started drawing letters with a computer when I first got one of my own in 1997. I’d been studying sans serif type as a project on the Typography &amp; Graphic Communication course that I was taking at Reading University, and learning about the different strands of development: ‘grotesques’ such as the delightful Monotype Series 215 were designed by type cutters or draftsmen, while geometric and humanist sans serifs like Futura and Gill Sans were constructed with compasses or quills by rationalist typographers and calligraphers. In the end, of course, they all needed a little wash and brush-up from the typefounder – to say nothing of the type designs. I was also in thrall of a typeface called Ehrhardt, a Monotype revival typeface that is based on a seventeenth century design by Miklos Kis. It too had endured a lot of cleaning, but though they were hard on the source material, those responsible created a very elegant condensed typeface. The result looks a bit like a house on an Amsterdam canal. Puritan was my response to these influences; it was also a way (I thought) that I could get hold of an interesting typeface without unofficially borrowing from the Typography department. It might be flawed, but it was mine! Well, I learned a lot from the experience. I wrote a short essay about Puritan as a project in my final year as an undergraduate. Rather than repeat it all here, I have converted the essay (presented as a booklet) into <a href=\"http://readingtype.org.uk/type/fonts/afterthoughts.pdf\"> a PDF file</a> of around 1200K which you can download. In October 1999, I submitted Puritan to the 3rd International Type Design Contest, where it made absolutely no impact.",

The letters are designed slightly wide, with open counters, a large x-height in the Latin glyphs, and so on. The Devanagari glyphs are the same height as the Latin capitals to allow them to stand alongside the oversized Latin lowercase. Historical models for Rhodium’s design are Fortune (AKA Volta) by Konrad Bauer and Walter Baum, and Rex by Intertype. Matthew Carter’s Verdana provided insight into designing type for small sizes and adverse reading environments.The Devanagari glyph set supports contemporary Hindi, Marathi, and Nepali. The Latin glyph set supports Adobe’s Latin-3 character set.

    "description": "Roboto Flex upgrades Roboto so it becomes a more powerful typeface system. With Flex, you can customize Roboto to express and finesse your text in ways never before possible. Today, people are constantly switching between devices, resizing browsers, and spreading our viewports across multiple screens. So Google commissioned Font Bureau to re-imagine Roboto to “flex” along with us, with a special emphasis on large-screen capabilities. This was achieved by amplifying the original design to an extreme range of weights, grades, widths and optical sizes.The second benefit of Roboto Flex is the designer’s ability to fitness and fine-tune their designs with <a href=\"https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/parametric_axes\">parametric axes</a>. Font Bureau first demonstrated the concept of parametric axes in <a href=\"https://www.axis-praxis.org/specimens/amstelvar\">Amstelvar Alpha</a> (2017), to provide the ultimate in typographic flexibility. With early prototypes of Roboto Flex, Font Bureau demonstrated new solutions to the typographic problems that digital designers face. Demonstrations of high quality justification, better dark-mode typography and other uses of parametric axes are documented at <a href=\"https://variablefonts.typenetwork.com\">variablefonts.typenetwork.com</a>The needs of developers, designers, and — of course — end-user readers were prioritized and aligned during development. To make Roboto Flex production-ready for all print and digital media, Font Bureau expanded the glyph set with careful planning and development, in partnership with script experts for Cyrillic and Greek. Rigorous testing of each glyph across every axis required new type design tools to be developed, like <a href=\"https://typetools.typenetwork.com/\">typetools</a> and <a href=\"https://videoproof.typenetwork.com/\">videoproof</a>, which can be used to explore the depth of the design.The final file size of the complete package is remarkably small, given the range of expressive styles now available. By driving variable fonts technology to its limits, it offers the most interesting and useful typographic tools for end users and designers. With a fully loaded Optical Size axis, Roboto Flex makes the layout of texts with deep hierarchies more straightforward and heightens the quality of every design that uses it.And none of this would be possible without the long list of contributors involved.

Like the other members of the Roboto family, the fonts are optimized for readability on screens across a wide variety of devices and reading environments. While the monospaced version is related to its variable width cousin, it doesn&#8217;t hesitate to change forms to better fit the constraints of a monospaced environment. For example, narrow glyphs like &#8216;I&#8217;, &#8216;l&#8217; and &#8216;i&#8217; have added serifs for more even texture while wider glyphs are adjusted for weight. Curved caps like &#8216;C&#8217; and &#8216;O&#8217; take on the straighter sides from Roboto Condensed.Special consideration is given to glyphs important for reading and writing software source code. Letters with similar shapes are easy to tell apart. Digit &#8216;1&#8217;, lowercase &#8216;l&#8217; and capital &#8216;I&#8217; are easily differentiated as are zero and the letter &#8216;O&#8217;. Punctuation important for code has also been considered. For example, the curly braces &#8216;{&nbsp;}&#8217; have exaggerated points to clearly differentiate them from parenthesis &#8216;(&nbsp;)&#8217; and braces &#8216;[&nbsp;]&#8217;.

Created primarily for display use, the extreme difference between its letters’ thick and thin strokes make it an excellent choice for large headlines and poster-sized graphics. The Indian Type Foundry released Rozha One in 2014; its Devanagari character set was designed by Tim Donaldson and Jyotish Sonowal. Shiva Nallaperumal designed the Latin.The font’s Latin characters are drawn in a fat face ‘modern’ or ‘Didone’ style, similar to letters that were commonly used in 19th century advertising posters in the West. Rozha One’s Latin characters barely differentiate between upper and lowercase letter sizes; the x-height of its lowercase letters is so high – and the size of its capital letters so small – that these virtually blend into one another in a line of text. Nevertheless, the Devanagari letters are drawn in such a way that they harmonise with the font’s Latin very well in settings where texts in multiple languages sit alongside one another. The headline of the Devanagari base characters is the same thickness as the Latin letters’ serifs. Certain Devanagari letter strokes and vowel marks bare visually similarity to the font’s Latin letters. However, Rozha One does not appear Latinized or un-Devanagari.The font includes 1,095 glyphs, offering full support for the conjuncts and ligatures required by languages written with the Devanagari script. When used in on-screen design environments, Rozha One should be used in very large pixel sizes. However in print, the design may be used in a broader range of sizes, perhaps even as small as at 16 or 18 points.The Rozha project is led by Indian Type Foundry, a type design foundry based in Ahmedabad, India.

The Indian Type Foundry’s font families have been an exception, however. Sarpanch continues this trend. Sarpanch is an Open Source typeface supporting the Devanagari and Latin scripts. It was designed for use in large point sizes and pixel sizes. Sarpanch’s letterforms are made up of strokes with a high contrast. They are also drawn with wide proportions, based on a squared construction principle.Six fonts make up the Sarpanch family, ranging in weight from Regular to Black. As weight increases along the family’s axis, vertical strokes become thicker, but the typeface’s horizontals retain the same thickness across each weight. While the rather wide Regular weight of the family is almost monolinear, the Black weight appears to have a very high degree of contrast.The Regular, Medium and Semibold fonts are recommended for use in short headlines, while Bold, Heavy and Black are intended primarily for setting single words or pairs. At display sizes, Sarpanch works equally well on screen or in print. Each font contains 1035 glyphs and offers full support for the conjuncts and ligatures required by languages written in the Devanagari script.The Medium–Black weights of the Sarpanch family were design by Manushi Parikh at ITF in 2014. Jyotish Sonowal designed the Regular weight. Sarpanch is an excellent choice for use in advertising or for news tickers on television screens (breaking news, etc.) In Hindi, the word Sarpanch means ‘the head of a village’.",

Sevillana is a generalized character based on that diversity, a headline typeface that can be used in middle and large sizes, it can be used for restaurant menus, concert posters, different kinds of signage etc. Designed by <a href=\"https://profiles.google.com/olga.umpeleva/about\">Olga Umpeleva</a> for Brownfox.

Source Serif is loosely based on the work of Pierre Simon Fournier, and many idiosyncrasies typical to Fournier’s designs (like the bottom serif on the b or the middle serif on the w) are also found in Source Serif. Without being a pure historical revival, Source Serif takes cues from Fournier and reworks them for a modern age. Both typeface families have different personalities because they spring from the hands of different designers: Source Serif was designed by Frank Grießhammer, Source Sans was designed by Paul Hunt. Robert Slimbach consulted on both designs, which helped maintain the overall family harmony. Either design feels confident on its own but also works in combination with the other — just like their designers do. Source Serif continues <a href=\"https://github.com/adobe-fonts/\">Adobe’s line of high-quality open source typefaces</a>. Designed for a digital environment, the letter shapes are simplified and highly readable. Its historical roots, combined with expert guidance give the typeface a strong character of its own that will shine when used for extended text on paper or screen.

This motif allows for a vast array of setting possibilities. Though intended for display, Syncopate does work well for limited text runs. The letter forms are a modern and stylish sans serif inspired by the many trendy sans serif typefaces that are so prevalent today.

Thai letters have thick and thin strokes, similar to the Latin, together with rounded and airy looped terminals. Taviraj is a 9 weight family that includes italics. Taviraj is a Thai word that refers to the last two kings of Krungsri Ayutthaya, the former capital of Thailand. People also metaphorically refer to Taviraj as the fall of a dynasty, and that is the reason why it appeared in the poem written by King Rama V regarding the situation of Siam being threatened by French expansionism, with his majesty expressing his sorrow towards the possibility of the end of his era. A traditional Thai style of typeface is called &#8220;farangses,&#8221; which means french, and Taviraj is in this genre. This contradiction highlights its origin. A similarity between some glyphs such as ก ถ ภ ฤ ฦ and ฎ ฏ is something to take into consideration because it might lead to confusion when typesetting very short texts. Taviraj takes a specific approach when dealing with the thick and thin strokes of Thai glyphs. Other type designers of Thai fonts may like to use this approach as a reference. Formal looped Thai typefaces have delicate details so care must be taken when expanding them to heavier weights, to retain all the details.The size and position of Thai vowel and tone marks has been managed carefully because they are all relevant to readability, legibility, and overall texture.The Taviraj project is led by Cadson Demak, a type foundry in Thailand.

The Teko typeface features letterforms with low stroke contrast, square proportions and a structure that appears visually simple. The Regular, Medium and Semibold fonts are recommended for use in long headlines, while Bold is intended primarily for setting just one or two words. The Light is a beautiful variant that may be put to exceptionally good use in large headlines on websites. At display sizes, Teko works equally well on screen or in print. Each font contains 1090 glyphs, offering full support for the conjuncts and ligatures required by languages written with the Devanagari script. Teko is an excellent choice for use in advertising or for news tickers on television screens (breaking news, etc.) Manushi Parikh designed the Teko typeface for the Indian Type Foundry, who published it in 2014.

It saves space while preserving readability and legibility with its oval-shape looped terminal. This looped Thai and Transitional serif Latin works well in formal contexts. The similarity between some glyphs such as ก ถ ภ ฤ ฦ, and ฎ and ฏ is something to take into consideration because it might lead to confusion when typesetting very short texts. Trirong takes a specific approach in how it deals with the thick and thin strokes in Thai glyphs. Other type designers of Thai fonts may like to use this approach as a reference.Formal looped Thai typefaces have delicate details, so it is important for type designers to take care when extending them into heavy weights and avoid obscuring important details. The sizes and positions of vowels and tone marks need to be managed carefully too, because they are all relevant to readability, legibility, and overall texture.The Trirong project is led by Cadson Demak, a type foundry in Thailand.

While the glyph design of Peter Wiegel’s font has hardly been changed at all, UnifrakturCook uses smart font technologies for displaying the font’s ligatures (OpenType, Apple Advanced Typography and SIL Graphite). An experimental feature is the distinction of good blackletter typography between required ligatures ‹ch, ck, ſt, tz› that must be kept when letterspacing is increased, and regular ligatures (for instance, ‹fi, fl›) that are broken up when letterspacing is increased. Using the ligatures: Whenever you type a sequence such as ‹tz›, it will automatically be displayed as a ligature. When you want to oppress a ligature, for instance in the German word «Zeitzone» ‘time zone’ that should have no tz-ligature, then you put a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-width_non-joiner\">zero width non-joiner</a> between the ‹t› and the ‹z› or, alternatively, you write «Zeit&amp;zwnj;zone» in the HTML code.

I used a variety of tools, including Gimp, Python/PIL, and of course, FontForge.  The VT320 glyphs were designed with a nonrectangular pixel aspect ratio to fit the way the terminal scanned the CRT, so for this VT323 variation I had Python munge the locations and attempt to emulate the way the electron beam actually illuminated the phosphor and smeared the pixels horizontally on the terminal's CRT, so it looks more like what the actual glyph looked like on the screen. Python then drew the proper pixels into a 1:1 pixel grid as a monochrome PNG, which FontForge autoscanned into outlines.  I have attempted to support most of the glyphs available on the VT320, but that is a limited set to begin with, so please don't be disappointed that I haven't supported Esperanto or Riograndenser Hunsrückisch or whatever. There is another earlier variation called \"VT321\" that uses a more standard 1:1 pixel drawing technique, if you want to grab that as well.
